# SongImageDownloader
A simple console program written in java that downloads album art for songs using Music Brainz. If no album image is found, it tries to download artist image from lastfm

## How to use
Either build using Intellij Idea or run the .jar file using the command:
`java -jar AlbumArtDownloader.jar`

The java must be in the folder containing the mp3s. In case of Idea, the mp3s must be in the root folder.
